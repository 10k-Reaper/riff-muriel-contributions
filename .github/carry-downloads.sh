# Usage: carry-downloads.sh <release tag> <file name> <count from before this existed>
# Prints how often <file name> of a rolling release has been downloaded over all its builds.
# GitHub resets a file's download count whenever the file is replaced, which every build does. So each
# build writes the running total into its release notes (an HTML comment the website reads), and the
# next build adds the replaced file's own count to it before deleting the old release.
